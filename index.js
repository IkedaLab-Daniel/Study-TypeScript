/**
 * Challenge: write another utility function, completeOrder, that takes an orderId as a parameter
 * finds the correct order in the orderQueue, and marks its status as "completed". For good measure,
 * return the found order from the function.
 * 
 * Note: you'll need to ensure that we're adding IDs to our orders when we create new orders. You can use a global `nextOrderId` variable and increment it every time a new order is created to simulate real IDs being managed for us by a database.
